# 🛠️ UC Discovery Hub - Development Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide explains how to use the development workflow system, log your progress, and maintain documentation for the UC Discovery Hub project.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run setup

# Start both backend and frontend
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run dev:backend    # Backend only (port 5000)
npm run dev:frontend   # Frontend only (port 8080)
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Log a new task
npm run log:start "API Integration" "Setting up React Query"

# Log completion
npm run log:complete "ExhibitUpload API" "Connected to backend" "src/components/ExhibitUpload.tsx"

# Update progress
npm run log:progress "ExhibitMap" 80 "Added data fetching"

# Log an issue
npm run log:issue "Authentication Bug" "JWT token not persisting"

# Log a decision
npm run log:decision "Use React Query" "Better caching and synchronization"

# Check current status
npm run log:status

# Update documentation
npm run update:docs
```

## 📝 Development Logging System

### Purpose
The development logging system tracks:
- **Task Progress**: Start and completion of development tasks
- **Component Status**: Progress updates for individual components
- **Issues & Bugs**: Problems encountered during development
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture and implementation choices
- **File Changes**: Which files were modified in each task

### How It Works

#### 1. **Task Logging**
```bash
# Start a new task
npm run log:start "Task Name" "Description of what you're doing"

# Complete a task
npm run log:complete "Task Name" "What was accomplished" "file1.tsx,file2.tsx"
```

#### 2. **Progress Updates**
```bash
# Update component progress
npm run log:progress "ComponentName" 75 "Added new feature"
```

#### 3. **Issue Tracking**
```bash
# Log an issue
npm run log:issue "Issue Title" "Detailed description of the problem"
```

#### 4. **Decision Logging**
```bash
# Log a technical decision
npm run log:decision "Decision Title" "Rationale and reasoning"
```

### Log Entry Structure
Each log entry includes:
- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred
- **Action**: What was done
- **Status**: Current state (In Progress, Complete, Issue)
- **Phase**: Current development phase
- **Files Modified**: List of changed files
- **Notes**: Detailed description

---

## 📊 Documentation Management

### Automatic Updates

#### 1. **README.md Updates**
The `update-readme.js` script automatically updates:
- Project status and progress
- Component completion status
- API endpoint status
- Last updated timestamp

```bash
# Update README manually
npm run update:readme

# Update all documentation
npm run update:docs
```

#### 2. **Development Log**
The `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` file contains:
- Complete development history
- Phase-by-phase progress
- Technical decisions log
- Issue tracking
- Next steps and priorities

### Manual Updates

#### Updating Project Status
Edit `update-readme.js` to update:
```javascript
const projectStatus = {
  overallProgress: 80,  // Update overall progress
  currentPhase: 'Authentication Integration',
  phases: {
    apiIntegration: { status: 'Complete', progress: 100 },
    // ... other phases
  },
  components: {
    completed: ['ExhibitUpload.tsx', 'ExhibitMap.tsx'],
    inProgress: ['AdminLogin.tsx'],
    missing: ['Analytics Dashboard']
  }
};
```

## 🔧 Development Phases

### Current Phase: API Integration (25% Complete)

#### Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Backend API development (100%)
- ✅ Frontend UI components (90%)
- ✅ Database schema design (100%)

#### Current Tasks:
- 🔄 React Query setup
- 🔄 ExhibitUpload API integration
- 🔄 ExhibitMap data fetching
- 🔄 Authentication implementation

#### Next Steps:
1. **Set up React Query** for API management

- Connect AdminLogin to `/api/auth/login`
- Implement JWT token management
- Add protected routes
- Add user session management

#### Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard
- Create analytics components
- Connect to analytics endpoints
- Add data visualization
- Implement real-time updates

#### Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
- Unit testing implementation
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Code splitting

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Regular Logging**
- Log every significant task start and completion
- Update progress when components reach milestones
- Log issues immediately when encountered
- Document important technical decisions

### 2. **Documentation Updates**
- Run `npm run update:docs` after major changes
- Keep README.md current with project status
- Update component status as you work

### 3. **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start your day
npm run log:status

# Begin a task
npm run log:start "Task Name" "Description"

# Work on the task...

# Update progress
npm run log:progress "Component" 50 "Halfway done"

# Complete the task
npm run log:complete "Task Name" "What was accomplished" "files.tsx"

# Update documentation
npm run update:docs
```

### 4. **Issue Management**
- Log issues immediately when found
- Include detailed descriptions
- Note which files are affected
- Update when issues are resolved

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

### Check Current Status
```bash
npm run log:status
```

### View Development Log
```bash
# Open DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md in your editor
code DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
```

### Update Documentation
```bash
npm run update:docs
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Scripts not working**
```bash
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x dev-workflow.js update-readme.js
```

#### 2. **Documentation not updating**
- Check file permissions
- Ensure files exist in correct locations
- Verify JavaScript syntax in scripts

#### 3. **Log entries not appearing**
- Check file paths in scripts
- Verify markdown syntax
- Ensure DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md exists
